# Introduction
This project is about developing a wirelessly controlled Robot based onRaspberry pi single board computer. This project has the following main
functionality :
- Accepting wireless movement controls from client app in real-time forrobot movements.
- Transmitting video feed to the client application in real-time.Digital connectivity with HD video transmission.

## Purpose of the project :
- Rescue Missions : people during a natural disaster for example: Rescuing people fromThis robot can be used by NDRF teams to rescue
