# Introduction
This project is about developing a wirelessly controlled Robot based onRaspberry pi single board computer. This project has the following main
functionality :
- Accepting wireless movement controls from client app in real-time forrobot movements.
- Transmitting video feed to the client application in real-time.Digital connectivity with HD video transmission.

## Purpose of the project :
- Rescue Missions : people during a natural disaster for example: Rescuing people fromThis robot can be used by NDRF teams to rescue
  the rubles of a collapsed building after a massive earthquake. Recon mission : This robot can be used by Indian army to carry out.
- recon missions to locate enemies for example : Indian army can usethis robot to carry out recon mission during close quarter combat in
  urban environment and locate the enemies from relatively safedistance.
- Mobile home surveillance : want to keep an eye on their pets while they are away from home.This robot can be used by people who
